  "description": "* The lottery starts by accepting ETH transactions. Anyone having an Ethereum wallet can send a fixed amount of 0.1 ETH to the contract’s address. * The players send ETH directly to the contract address and their Ethereum address is registered. A user can send more transactions having more chances to win. * There is a manager, the account that deploys and controls the contract. * At some point, if there are at least 3 playesrs, he can pick a random winner from the players list. Only the manager is allowed to see the contract balance and to randomly select the winner. * The contract will transfer the entire balance to the winner’s address and the lottery is reset and ready for the next round.",
