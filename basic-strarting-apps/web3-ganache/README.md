## Simple progam to get started

Start Ganache.

Select 2 account and fill the code accordingly. Use the private key of the sending account to sign the txn.

Run the code 
```
node index.js
```

Increment nonce from 0 to 1 as you run the index.js.

The value send is in wei. So the balance might not change in the UI because of the small denomination.

Web3 only get involved when you are sending a txn to the network.
